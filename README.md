# pytia

pytia is a basic Python implementation of a TOBI interface A (TiA) server. TiA is a data transmission protocol developed as part of the [TOBI project](www.tobi-project.org). It is designed to allow a server acquiring data from multiple sensors to stream that data efficiently to one or more clients over TCP or UDP. For more information see [here](tools4bci.sourceforge.net/tia.html) and [here](tools4bci.sourceforge.net/signalserver.html).
